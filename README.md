# DiscreteDifferentialGeometry
This a github that, for the most part, serves as a set of tutorials for doing computational geometry and differential geometry in Python. Techniques range from symbolic manipulation using Sage to more heavy computations in numpy and trimesh. 

# Setup Instructions: 
1. Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
2. Open conda prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac / Linux
3. Command: conda create --name alggeo scipy scikit-learn numpy pandas jupyter matplotlib plotly
4. Command: conda activate alggeo 
5. Command: conda install -c conda-forge sage *(This will take a very long time.)*
6. Command: conda install -c conda-forge trimesh
